# Reusable workflows and matrix strategies

_Make a workflow reusable, call it in another workflow, and use a matrix strategy to run multiple versions._

## Step 4: Merge your changes

_Nicely done! :partying_face:_

You've added a matrix strategy to your workflow file that is now running on four different versions of node `[14, 16, 18, 20]` instead of the single hard-coded version of only `14`.

We'll now merge your changes so that your workflow file changes will be part of the `main` branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create and merge your pull request

1. Merge your changes from `reusable-workflow` into `main`. If you created the pull request in step 1, open that PR and click on **Merge pull request**. If you did not create the pull request earlier, you can do it now by following the instructions in step 1.
1. Optionally, click **Delete branch** to delete your `reusable-workflow` branch.
1. Wait about 20 seconds for actions to run, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) and an action will automatically close this step and open the next one.
